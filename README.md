# Codex

I haven't yet determined the full scope of this project.
Presently this is a marionettejs application boilerplate.

Application bootstrap is handled by configuration (`config.js`).
Controller actions are wrapped in dispatch events.

View the console when loading the [project page](http://rabbit.github.com/codex)
for a better idea of events that are firing.
